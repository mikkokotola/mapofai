# Map of AI

The repository contains a visualization of different narrow machine learning/artificial intelligence tasks, their domain areas and examples of services in the different domain areas. The readme also contains some thoughts on the philosophy related to AI.

## State of AI
What is artificial intelligence (AI)? In the last decades and still today, AI has really been *narrow AIs*, machine learning (ML) models trained for a specific tasks. These tasks can be grouped into domain areas to better understand which tasks belong together. In 2023, we already have cross-task models, such as ChatGPT capable of executing several natural language generation (NLG) tasks and Gato capable of playing Atari games, captioning images, chatting in English and stacking blocks with a real robot arm. The development in inching towards artificial general intelligence (AGI), an AI capable of learning any intellectual task that a human can learn.

## Reflections on intelligence, creativity and morality of machines
*Reflections by Mikko Kotola*

### Are machines intelligent and creative?
What is intelligence? What is creativity? 

I do not believe there is any fundamental difference between humans as information processing creatures and computers as information processing machines. Humans experience the world through the human senses, as images, sounds, smells, touches and tastes. Humans gradually learn about the world before and after birth and growing up. Humans act in the world by speaking, moving and interacting with other humans and machines. Machines experience the world as they are built to experience: as training sets of images for computer vision models, as text and conversations for NLG models. Machines learn about the world when explicitly trained or exposed to data in a not fully supervised setting. Machines act by generating text (which can be converted to sound), generating images and moving robotics arms. The physical composition of a human is still quite different from a machine, but machines can be build using different kinds of materials - in the end of the same low-level stuff (molecules, atoms) that humans are made of. I understand intelligence to refer to such capabilities as learning, problem-solving, reasoning, and adapting to new circumstances. I don't think there is any fundamental difference separating humans and machines in these capabilities.

I undestand creativity as the ability to produce new and original ideas or things. Creativity involves using one's imagination and originality to generate ideas that are valuable and novel. But where do they come from? They certainly do not come out of *nowhere*. New ideas come from our previous experiences. When I write songs, I am just letting my mind spin and spit out notes,sounds, chord progressions and lyrics coming from the Metallica songs I listened to as a teenager, the Finnish folk music I listen to nowadays and the ups and downs I have lived through during my humble life. Creating new *is* combining things I have seen, experienced and learned. Anyone having created images with the latest text-to-image models probably agrees that the images are novel and valuable - creative.

### Are machines moral subjects?
Morality is prescriptive, not descriptive. We humans as moral subjects have moral emotions towards other moral subjects, other humans. If someone deviates from my beliefs and values radically, I despise him or her and do not seek to collaborate with that person. If someone has similar beliefs and values, I commend that person and build trust and friendship. We define our own social and moral communities. But as we define our own moral communities, could machines also become part of our moral communities? Well, it's a question of reciprocal moral emotions. Do you feel good if ChatGPT commends your code? Do you thank it for its solutions to your problems? If yes, you might be on the way to having emotions towards a machine. Does it feel emotions towards you? I do not know. I am not a machine. Or a bat. Or another human. But I certainly would not rule our the possibility of machines as moral subjects.
